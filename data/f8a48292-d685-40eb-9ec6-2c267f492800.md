The basic challenge is all about cramming more transistors into a smaller area, to get more and more performance. In this respect, we really are pushing the limits.

This basic principle can be called as **Level of integration**, which kind of measures the degree of this cramming.
#### In this respect, VLSI stands for Very High Scale Integration
**For example:** The Intel Pentium contains about 3 to 6 million transistors. That's a lot! This note is being written in 2021, and we don't even use Pentiums now because they are so old! So imagine today's chips! One AMD Ryzen model contains about 4.8 billion chips!

## Moore's Law
[Link to Wikipedia Article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law)
<br></br>
> **Moore's law** is the observation that the number of transistors in a dense integrated circuit (IC) doubles about every two years. Moore's law is an observation and projection of a historical trend. Rather than a law of physics, it is an empirical relationship linked to gains from experience in production.

Moore's prediction has been used in the semiconductor industry to guide long-term planning and to set targets for research and development, thus functioning a bit like a self-fulfilling prophecy. Advancements in digital electronics, such as the reduction in quality-adjusted microprocessor prices, the increase in memory capacity (RAM and flash), the improvement of sensors, and even the number and size of pixels in digital cameras, are strongly linked to Moore's law. These step changes in digital electronics have been a driving force of technological and social change, productivity, and economic growth.

## Scales of Integration
<br></br>
- **SSI:** The first integrated circuits contained only a few transistors and so were called “Small-Scale Integration (SSI). They used circuits containing transistors numbering in the tens.
- **MSI:** Medium-scale integration is the process of embedding hundreds of transistors in one integrated circuit or microchip
    - Medium-scale integration was developed in the early days of mainframe computers.
- **LSI:** LSI consists of thousands of transistors that are closely embedded and integrated with a very small microchip. It is no longer in use but is succeeded by VLSI
    - One of the first components built on LSI technology was 1-K bit RAM, which contained 4,000 transistors
- **VLSI:** Very-large-scale integration is the process of creating an integrated circuit by combining millions of MOS transistors onto a single chip. VLSI began in the 1970s when MOS integrated circuit chips were widely adopted, enabling complex semiconductor and telecommunication technologies to be developed.
- **ULSI:** Ultra large-scale integration (ULSI) is the process of integrating or embedding millions of transistors on a single silicon semiconductor microchip. ULSI technology was conceived during the late 1980s when superior computer processor microchips, specifically for the Intel 8086 series, were under development
