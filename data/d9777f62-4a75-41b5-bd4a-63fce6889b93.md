# PL/SQL

<h2>But what is PL/SQL?</h2>

[GeeksforGeeks PL/SQL](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/plsql-introduction/)
<br>
PL/SQL seems to be some logical constructs(like if-else and loops and possibly functions) added on top of SQL, to make it a more complete language
<br></br>
> **According to GeeksForGeeks:** PL/SQL is a block-structured language that enables developers to combine the power of SQL with procedural statements.All the statements of a block are passed to the Oracle engine all at once which increases processing speed and decreases the traffic.

At the start of any code in PL/SQL write **set serveroutput on;**

### Disadvantages of standard SQL:
- SQL doesnâ€™t provide the programmers with a technique of condition checking, looping and branching.
- SQL statements are passed to Oracle engine one at a time which increases traffic and decreases speed.
- SQL has no facility of error checking during manipulation of data.

### Differences between SQL and PL/SQL:
|SQL|PL/SQL|
|-|-|
|SQL is a single query that is used to perform DML and DDL operations.|PL/SQL is a block of codes that used to write the entire program blocks/ procedure/ function, etc.|
|It is declarative, that defines what needs to be done, rather than how things need to be done.|PL/SQL is procedural that defines how the things needs to be done.|
|Execute as a single statement.|Execute as a whole block.|
|Mainly used to manipulate data.|Mainly used to create an application.|
|Cannot contain PL/SQL code in it.|It is an extension of SQL, so it can contain SQL inside it.|

### Sample Code:
```
SQL> SET SERVEROUTPUT ON; 

SQL> DECLARE 
	var1 INTEGER; 
	var2 REAL; 
	var3 varchar2(20) ; 

BEGIN 
	null; 
END; 
/ 
```
